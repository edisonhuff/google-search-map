Zenefits Simple Map

Tools Used: vanilla javascript, css and google places API.

I've provided a spartan interface

Searchbar uses the text search api, and is fairly flexible.
The Searchbar is also biased towards the center of the map and has an autocomplete feature.

Searching generates a list of Items and resizes the map / populates it with markers.

When a marker is clicked, it will bring up an infocard with the name and address of the place associated with it.

When list items are hovered they their marker bounce.
When a list item is clicked, the map centers on its marker and pulls up the details page.

Both the Details page and list/searchbar are collapsable.

I apologize for the monolithic main.js file, I wanted to build this out as minimalistically as possible.

I hope my comments provided are helpful.

Sincerley,

Edison Huff
